alternatively is there anyone else we can think of who could tell us about how sharepoint is used in a big corporation? sanjay at gkn?

lul. is there a gallery with "best of amazon" reviews somewhere on the webs? if not it should be done.

i just discovered it's possible to dismantle the visualisation and make pretty designs with the pieces

I had a look at the messages on tryfan and I don't think the problem is draft messages.
I could not find partial messages (consistent with drafts). I did find 12(!) duplicates of the
same messages with different file names ('ddddd-ddddd.msg') - most likely these are
the messages distributed via the mailman list to the various recipients.

I think email_message_appends (or whatever) does not handle duplicate
messages in the system correctly (as opposed to the duplicates we created
when rsyncing between the servers).

Due to it being Easter, St Peter's Church is not available for Thursday 9th April. Our usual alternative venue, 
the Synergy Centre is in the process of moving location so we are temporarily homeless. There's a couple of 
options being followed up, but if anyone knows of a suitable and available venue for Sweaty Thursday, please get in touch.

This sounds familiar:

This code does three things:
    * Runs a web app that allows you to manage a set of media sources and their feeds.
    * Periodically crawls the feeds setup within the web app and downloads any new stories found within the downloaded feeds.
    * Extracts the substantive text from the downloaded story content (minus the ads, navigation, comments, etc) 
and associates a set of tags with each story based on that extracted text.

The system is written perl on top of postgres and uses the catalyst web application framework for the web application.

We've been running the code for almost a year now in production, but we're publishing this as an alpha 
release because we have not extensively documented the installation or use of the system.
